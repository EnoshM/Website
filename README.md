# Website
Hello there, and welcome to my Github repository!

This is where you can find all of the code for my blog posts at my website, https://enoshm.wixsite.com/enosh

You're free to use the code you find here for your own purposes. And for explanations, you can head over to my website blog page where I go into each script in detail.

Anyways, happy coding!
